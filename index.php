			<p>Welcome! My name is Julio Ramos, and I’m from East Coast, specifically New Hampshire. I moved to Portland, Oregon with my older sister when I was 18 (9 years ago) to see what the West Coast had to offer, and don’t plan on moving back. I currently live in Seattle with my wife and two cat babies..</p>
			<p>I’m in the web development program, and in the future, I would like to either work with a medium sized company, creating and maintaining websites that are visually striking, or I would like to do freelancing, finding people with a passion for what they do, and who want a website(s) that go beyond simple functionality.</p>
			<p>Outside of making websites, I enjoy working on logos and design more broadly. I have been making designs and logos for about two years, and I enjoy it about as much as website design.</p>
